# Data Structure and Agorithms in Python
Data structures and algorithms walkthrough in Python

### 1. LINKED LISTS: PYTHON

**Linked List Review**

*_I have implemented a linked list in Python! by:_*

- Defining a Node class to hold the values and links between nodes
- Implementing a LinkedList class to handle external operations on the list like adding and removing nodes


### 2. QUEUES: PYTHON

**Queues Python Review**

*_I have implemented a queue data structure in Python by creating a Queue class that:_*

- follows FIFO protocol with enqueue(), dequeue(), and peek() methods
- gives you the option of creating bounded queues with a max_size
- prevents queue “overflow” and “underflow” by keeping track of size


### 3. STACKS: PYTHON

**Stacks Python Review**

*_I have built out a Stack class that can:_*

- add a new item to the top via a push() method
- remove an item from the top and returns its value with a pop() method
- return the value of the top item using a peek() method
- allows a stack instance to maintain an awareness of its size to prevent stack “overflow”
